# G-Class-Automator
Tool to auto-launch google meets from google classrooms because I'm too lazy to do all the clicking by myself.

You'll need Chromedriver to make this work, download link [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
(Download the correct version according to the version of Chrome you're using righjt now that you can check in the Control Panel)
Extract the chromedriver.exe file to a suitable place and add the absolute path to the chrome_path variable in the code.

Replace the meeting links with yours and change the if-else ladder to your convenience.
